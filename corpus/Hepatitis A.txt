== Signs and symptoms ==
Early symptoms of hepatitis A infection can be mistaken for influenza, but some sufferers, especially children,  exhibit no symptoms at all.  Symptoms typically appear 2 to 6 weeks (the incubation period) after the initial infection. About 90% of children do not have symptoms. The time between infection and symptoms, in those who develop them, is between 2 and 6 weeks with an average of 28 days.The risk for symptomatic infection is directly related to age, with more than 80% of adults having symptoms compatible with acute viral hepatitis and the majority of children having either asymptomatic or unrecognized infections.Symptoms usually last less than 2 months, although some people can be ill for as long as 6 months:
Fatigue
Fever
Nausea
Appetite loss
Jaundice, a yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes owing to hyperbilirubinemia
Bile is removed from the bloodstream and excreted in the urine, giving it a dark amber color
Diarrhea
Light, or clay-colored faeces (acholic faeces)
Abdominal discomfort
