"Confusion is the state of being bewildered or unclear. The term ""acute mental confusion"" is often used interchangeably with delirium in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems and the Medical Subject Headings publications to describe the pathology. These refer to the loss of orientation, or the ability to place oneself correctly in the world by time, location and personal identity. Mental confusion is sometimes accompanied by disordered consciousness (the loss of linear thinking) and memory loss (the ability to correctly recall previous events or learn new material). The term is from Latin confusio, -onis, from confundere: ""to pour together;"" ""to mingle together;"" ""to confuse"".
