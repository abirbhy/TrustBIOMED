== Signs and symptoms ==

Patients suffering from cerebellar degeneration experience a progressive loss of nerve cells (Purkinje cells) throughout the cerebellum. As well as this, it is common to incur an elevated blood protein level and a high volume of lymph cells within the cerebrospinal fluid, resulting in swelling and enlargement of the brain. The most characteristic signs and symptoms experienced by patients with cerebellar degeneration include:
muscle weakness
an uncoordinated, staggering walk
quivering of the torso
jerky arm and leg movements
tendency to falling over
dysarthria (difficulty in articulating speech)
dysphagia (difficulty in deglutition/swallowing of solids and liquids)
vertigo (dizziness)
nystagmus (rapid, involuntary eye movements), causing sleep disturbances
ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of extraocular muscles)
diplopia (double vision)Scientific studies have revealed that psychiatric symptoms are also common in patients with cerebellar degeneration, where dementia is a typical psychiatric disorder resulting from cerebellar damage. Approximately 50% of all patients suffer from dementia as a result of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration.
