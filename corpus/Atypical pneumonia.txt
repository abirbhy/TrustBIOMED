== Signs and symptoms ==
Usually the atypical causes also involve atypical symptoms:

No response to common antibiotics such as sulfonamide and beta-lactams like penicillin.
No signs and symptoms of lobar consolidation, meaning that the infection is restricted to small areas, rather than involving a whole lobe. As the disease progresses, however, the look can tend to lobar pneumonia.
Absence of leukocytosis.
Extrapulmonary symptoms, related to the causing organism.
Moderate amount of sputum, or no sputum at all (i.e. non-productive).
Lack of alveolar exudate.
Despite general symptoms and problems with the upper respiratory tract (such as high fever, headache, a dry irritating cough followed later by a productive cough with radiographs showing consolidation), there are in general few physical signs. The patient looks better than the symptoms suggest.
