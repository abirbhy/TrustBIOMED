"The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), previously myeloproliferative diseases (MPDs), are a group of diseases of the bone marrow in which excess cells are produced. They are related to, and may evolve into, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, although the myeloproliferative diseases on the whole have a much better prognosis than these conditions. The concept of myeloproliferative disease was first proposed in 1951 by the hematologist William Dameshek. In the most recent World Health Organization classification of hematologic malignancies, this group of diseases was renamed from ""myeloproliferative diseases"" to ""myeloproliferative neoplasms"". This reflects the underlying clonal genetic changes that are a salient feature of this group of disease.
The increased numbers of blood cells may not cause any symptoms, but a number of medical problems or symptoms may occur. The risk of thrombosis is increased in some types of MPN.
