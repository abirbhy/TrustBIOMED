== Signs and symptoms ==
The primary symptom is yellowish discoloration of the white part of the eyes and skin in a newborn baby. Other symptoms may include excess sleepiness or poor feeding.A bilirubin level more than 34 µmol/l (2 mg/dL) may be visible. For the feet to be affected level generally must be over 255 µmol/l (15 mg/dL).


=== Complications ===
Prolonged hyperbilirubinemia (severe jaundice) can result in chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus).  Quick and accurate treatment of neonatal jaundice helps to reduce the risk of neonates developing kernicterus.Infants with kernicterus may have a fever or seizures. High pitched crying is an effect of kernicterus.
Exchange transfusions performed to lower high bilirubin levels are an aggressive treatment.
