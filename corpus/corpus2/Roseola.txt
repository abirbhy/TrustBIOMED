== Signs and symptoms ==
Roseola typically affects children between six months and two years of age, and begins with a sudden high fever (39–40 °C; 102.2-104 °F). In rare cases, this can cause febrile convulsions (also known as febrile seizures or ""fever fits"") due to the sudden rise in body temperature, but in many cases the child appears normal. After a few days the fever subsides, and just as the child appears to be recovering, a red rash appears. This usually begins on the trunk (torso) and then spreads to the arms, legs, and neck. The rash is not itchy and may last 1 to 2 days. In contrast, a child suffering from measles would usually appear sicker, with symptoms of conjunctivitis, cold-like symptoms, and a cough, and their rash would affect the face and last for several days. Liver dysfunction can occur in rare cases.
A small percentage of children acquire HHV-6 with few sign or symptoms of the disease. Exanthema subitum occurs in approximately 30% of children during primary HHV-6 infection. Others may show symptoms significant enough that other more serious infections, such as meningitis or measles should be ruled out. In case of febrile seizures, medical advice can be sought for reassurance. However, febrile seizures are not harmful, do not require treatment, and have no long term negative effects unless they last longer than five minutes.
In rare cases, HHV-6 can become active in an adult previously infected during childhood and can show signs of mononucleosis.
