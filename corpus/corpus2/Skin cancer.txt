== Signs and symptoms ==
There are a variety of different skin cancer symptoms. These include changes in the skin that do not heal, ulcering in the skin, discolored skin, and changes in existing moles, such as jagged edges to the mole and enlargement of the mole.


=== Basal-cell skin cancer ===
Basal-cell skin cancer (BCC) usually presents as a raised, smooth, pearly bump on the sun-exposed skin of the head, neck or shoulders. Sometimes small blood vessels (called telangiectasia) can be seen within the tumor. Crusting and bleeding in the center of the tumor frequently develops. It is often mistaken for a sore that does not heal. This form of skin cancer is the least deadly and with proper treatment can be completely eliminated, often without scarring.


=== Squamous-cell skin cancer ===
Squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) is commonly a red, scaling, thickened patch on sun-exposed skin.  Some are firm hard nodules and dome shaped like keratoacanthomas.  Ulceration and bleeding may occur. When SCC is not treated, it may develop into a large mass. Squamous-cell is the second most common skin cancer. It is dangerous, but not nearly as dangerous as a melanoma.


=== Melanoma ===
Most melanoma consist of various colours from shades of brown to black. A small number of melanoma are pink, red or fleshy in colour; these are called amelanotic melanoma and tend to be more aggressive. Warning signs of malignant melanoma include change in the size, shape, color or elevation of a mole. Other signs are the appearance of a new mole during adulthood or pain, itching, ulceration, redness around the site, or bleeding at the site. An often-used mnemonic is ""ABCDE"",  where A is for ""asymmetrical"", B for ""borders"" (irregular: ""Coast of Maine sign""), C for ""color"" (variegated), D for ""diameter"" (larger than 6 mm – the size of a pencil eraser) and E for ""evolving.""


=== Other ===
Merkel cell carcinomas are most often rapidly growing, non-tender red, purple or skin colored bumps that are not painful or itchy.  They may be mistaken for a cyst or another type of cancer.
