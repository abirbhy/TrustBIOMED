== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms of PCP include fever, nonproductive cough (because sputum is too viscous to become productive), shortness of breath (especially on exertion), weight loss, and night sweats. Usually, not a large amount of sputum is produced with PCP unless the patient has an additional bacterial infection. The fungus can invade other visceral organs (such as the liver, spleen, and kidney), but only in a minority of cases.
Pneumothorax is a well-known complication of PCP. An acute history of chest pain with breathlessness and diminished breath sounds is typical of pneumothorax.
