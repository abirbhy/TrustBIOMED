== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs/symptoms of tricuspid insufficiency are generally those of right-sided heart failure, such as ascites and peripheral edema.Tricuspid insufficiency may lead to the presence of a pansystolic heart murmur. Such a murmur is usually of low frequency and best heard low on the lower left sternal border. As with most right-sided phenomena, it tends to increase with inspiration, and decrease with expiration. This is known as Carvallo's sign. However, the murmur may be inaudible indicating the relatively low pressures in the right side of the heart. A third heart sound may also be present, also heard with inspiration at the lower sternal border.In addition to the possible ausculatory findings above, there are other signs indicating the presence of tricuspid regurgitation. There may be giant C-V waves in the jugular pulse and a palpably (and sometimes visibly) pulsatile liver on abdominal exam. Since the murmur of tricupsid regurgitation may be faint or inaudible, these signs can be helpful in establishing the diagnosis.
