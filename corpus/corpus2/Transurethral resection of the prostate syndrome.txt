== Symptoms and signs ==
The clinical picture of TURP syndrome will vary according to its severity, and may further be influenced by the type of irrigant used.
There is no classical presentation for TURP syndrome, indeed signs and symptoms are often vague and non-specific, therefore in the correct clinical context the clinician should have a high index of suspicion.
Most of the manifestations are secondary to fluid overload.
