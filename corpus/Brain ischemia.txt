The symptoms of brain ischemia reflect the anatomical region undergoing blood and oxygen deprivation. Ischemia within the arteries branching from the internal carotid artery may result in symptoms such as blindness in one eye, weakness in one arm or leg, or weakness in one entire side of the body. Ischemia within the arteries branching from the vertebral arteries in the back of the brain may result in symptoms such as dizziness, vertigo, double vision, or weakness on both sides of the body. Other symptoms include difficulty speaking, slurred speech, and the loss of coordination.  The symptoms of brain ischemia range from mild to severe.  Further, symptoms can last from a few seconds to a few minutes or extended periods of time.  If the brain becomes damaged irreversibly and infarction occurs, the symptoms may be permanent.Similar to cerebral hypoxia, severe or prolonged brain ischemia will result in unconsciousness, brain damage or death,  mediated by the ischemic cascade.Multiple cerebral ischemic events may lead to subcortical ischemic depression, also known as vascular depression. This condition is most commonly seen in elderly depressed patients. Late onset depression is increasingly seen as a distinct sub-type of depression, and can be detected with an MRI.
