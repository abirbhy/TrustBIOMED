During severe episodes of mania or depression people with bipolar disorder may have psychotic symptoms, such as  hallucinations or delusions. When experiencing hallucinations or delusions, people with schizophrenia often seem to ""lose touch"" with reality. ""Voices"" are the most common type of hallucination in schizophrenia. In bipolar disorder, the psychotic symptoms tend to reflect the person's extreme depressed or elated mood (mood congruence). People with either disorder may have delusions of grandeur in which they believe they are a famous person or historical figure. When psychotic symptoms are present, bipolar disorder is sometimes misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.Other symptoms of schizophrenia, including lack of pleasure difficulty making decisions, and difficulty focusing, are similar to some symptoms of depression seen in bipolar disorder. Jumping from one idea to another and being unusually distracted during a manic episode may resemble ""disorganized thinking,"" characteristic of schizophrenia.Substance abuse is a complicating factor for both conditions, making symptoms more difficult to recognize as a mental illness and interfering with treatment efficacy and adherence.
