== Signs and symptoms ==
Early signs of melanoma are changes to the shape or color of existing moles or, in the case of nodular melanoma, the appearance of a new lump anywhere on the skin. At later stages, the mole may itch, ulcerate or bleed. Early signs of melanoma are summarized by the mnemonic ""ABCDEF"":
Asymmetry
Borders (irregular with edges and corners)
Color (variegated)
Diameter (greater than 6 mm (0.24 in), about the size of a pencil eraser)
Evolving over time
Funny lookingThis classification does not apply to nodular melanoma, which has its own classifications:
Elevated above the skin surface
Firm to the touch
GrowingMetastatic melanoma may cause nonspecific paraneoplastic symptoms, including loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Metastasis of early melanoma is possible, but relatively rare: less than a fifth of melanomas diagnosed early become metastatic. Brain metastases are particularly common in patients with metastatic melanoma.  It can also spread to the liver, bones, abdomen or distant lymph nodes.
