== Signs and symptoms ==

Most of the women who develop DCIS do not experience any symptoms.  The majority of cases (80-85%) are detected through screening mammography.   The first signs and symptoms may appear if the cancer advances. Because of the lack of early symptoms, DCIS is most often detected at screening mammography.
In a few cases, DCIS may cause:

A lump or thickening in or near the breast or under the arm
A change in the size or shape of the breast
Nipple discharge or nipple tenderness; the nipple may also be inverted, or pulled back into the breast
Ridges or pitting of the breast; the skin may look like the skin of an orange
A change in the way the skin of the breast, areola, or nipple looks or feels such as warmth, swelling, redness or scaliness.
