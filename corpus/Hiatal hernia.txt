== Signs and symptoms ==

Hiatal hernia has often been called the ""great mimic"" because its symptoms can resemble many disorders. Among them, a person with a hiatal hernia can experience dull pains in the chest, shortness of breath (caused by the hernia's effect on the diaphragm), heart palpitations (due to irritation of the vagus nerve), and swallowed food ""balling up"" and causing discomfort in the lower esophagus until it passes on to the stomach.  In addition, hiatal hernias often result in heartburn but may also cause chest pain or pain with eating.In most cases however, a hiatal hernia does not cause any symptoms. The pain and discomfort that a patient experiences is due to the reflux of gastric acid, air, or bile. While there are several causes of acid reflux, it occurs more frequently in the presence of hiatal hernia.
